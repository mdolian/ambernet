CYGWIN USERS

There is now a single, self-contained package file available for
Cygwin users.  All you need is a basic Cygwin installation with Perl
installed.  Once you have this, download the
etree-scripts-<version>.cygwin.tar.gz file from Sourceforge
(http://etree-scripts.sourceforge.net/), and type:

	% cd /
	% tar xfz /path/to/etree-scripts-<version>.cygwin.tar.gz

And everything you need will be installed and ready to use.  You can
try getting started by typing "perldoc flacify" or "perldoc shn2mp3".

PREREQUISITES

For regular UNIX systems, you can install etree-scripts like any other
Perl package.  First, though, you should install these Perl modules:

	Date::Parse 	Optional, but formatting and parsing of dates will
			be sub-optimal without it.

	Audio::Wav	Optional.  Used by "unshn" to detect SBEs and
			non-CD-DA audio files.

	HTML::Parser	Required for the "makehbx" script.  See
			http://catchen.org/hillsboro/ for more info on
			HBX.

To install these Perl modules, you can generally just type:

	% cpan
	<answer any setup questions the first time thru>

	cpan> install Date::Parse
	<output>

	cpan> install HTML::Parser

and so on.  If you're using a package-based system like Debian or
RedHat Linux, these modules are probably available as installable
packages.  You may need to do a little digging to find them.  For
example, the libtime-date-perl package on Debian has the Date::Time
module.

You'll also need the following command line tools:

	shorten		If you deal with Shorten files, you need this.
			http://etree.org/shnutils/shorten/

	flac		If you deal with FLAC files, you need this
			http://flac.sourceforge.net/ .  Make sure
			metaflac is available as well to do tagging.

	shntool		Highly recommended.  Available from
			http://etree.org/shnutils/shntool/

	cdrecord        If you plan to burn one (or 1000...) down

	lame		If you intend on making any MP3s, you need this.
			http://lame.sourceforge.net/

	oggenc		Similarly, if you plan on making any Ogg Vorbis
			files using shn2ogg you will need this.
			http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/

INSTALLATION

Once you have the pre-requisites, installing etree-scripts is as
simple as:

	% perl Makefile.PL
	% make
	% make install

You can specify options to your hearts content if you know your way
around the Perl MakeMaker toolset.

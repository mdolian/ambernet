                                             |_| V3.1

Announcing release 3.1 of etree-scripts, a set of (mostly) Perl
scripts for lossless audio freaks who get busy on the command line.

This is a bug-fix release for version 3.0:

* Fixed bug in unshn where it reversed the arguments to the shorten
  command.

* Timestamp messages from flacify and shn2mp3.

Some important changes in version 3.0:

* Revamped parsing code.  The parser breaks up the info file first by
  paragraphs and identifies their content broadly before splitting and
  parsing things line-by-line.  The hope is that this leads to
  better quality parsing overall.  I am working on a
  Parse::RecDescent-based parser for the next major release.

* Much improved Cygwin support.  I use it myself now.  There is also a
  standalone Cygwin tar file that can be used to install etree-scripts
  and all prerequisites in a single step.  See INSTALL for more
  info.

* Major improvements to the "flacify" command:

  o Support for new FLAC 1.1 command line syntax (metaflac really)
  o Creates a file called ffp.txt in the output directory with the
    FLAC fingerprints for all files it has converted or tagged.
  o Renames .md5 files to .md5.orig
  o Automatically adds ReplayGain tags to FLAC files
  o Handles missing/unparseable info file gracefully

* The "shn2mp3" script will apply ReplayGain tags when extracting FLAC
  files, so resulting MP3s are normalized to 0db.

* Fixed a bug in the "cdfill" script where it could delete your
  original files.

* Scripts detect when running under ActiveState and abort.  Sorry, but
  AS Perl is too broken to work with these scripts.  Use Cygwin.

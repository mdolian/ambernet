=== 0.9.10 / 2009-01-19

* 1 major enhancement:

  * Ruby 1.9.1 compatibility

* 1 minor enhancement:

  * Updated Resource marshaling to be more thorough

=== 0.9.9 / 2009-01-04

* 1 minor enhancement:

  * Updated Resource and Collection to be serializable with Marshal

* 1 bug fix:

  * Fixed Model#copy to copy properties that are the same in both
    repositories.

=== 0.9.8 / 2008-12-07

* 3 minor enhancements:

  * Updated Resource#inspect to not lazy-load unloaded attributes.
  * Updated ManyToOne::Proxy to delegate #class to parent.  This will
    allow the Merb resource() route helper method to use the association
    proxy to generate the URL.
  * Updated Resource#attributes= to respect method visibility.  This means
    that only public mutators will set the attribute value.

* 1 bug fix:

  * Fixed regression where an update to a resource with a lazy property
    could cause the record to reload when accessing the lazy property,
    clobbering any changes made prior.

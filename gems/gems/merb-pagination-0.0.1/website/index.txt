h1. merb-pagination

h2. What

A pagination helper for merb. Useful with dm-is-paginated

h2. Installing

<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install merb-pagination</pre>

h2. The basics

Given a page count and the current page, we generate a set of pagination 
links.
 
We use an inner and outer window into a list of links. For a set of 20 pages with the current page being 10:

outer_window: @1 2 ... 19 20@
inner_window: @5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14@

This is totally adjustable, or can be turned off by giving the :inner_window setting a value of nil.

h2. Demonstration of usage

@:next_labe => text_for_next_link@
 
 Defaults to @' Next &raquo;'@

@:left_cut_label => text_for_cut@

 Used when the page numbers need to be cut off to prevent the set of pagination links from 
 being too long.

 the paginator from scratch, set this to false.

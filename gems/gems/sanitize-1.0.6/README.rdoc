= Sanitize

Sanitize is a whitelist-based HTML sanitizer. Given a list of acceptable
elements and attributes, Sanitize will remove all unacceptable HTML from a
string.

Using a simple configuration syntax, you can tell Sanitize to allow certain
elements, certain attributes within those elements, and even certain URL
protocols within attributes that contain URLs. Any HTML elements or attributes
that you don't explicitly allow will be removed.

Because it's based on Hpricot, a full-fledged HTML parser, rather than a bunch
of fragile regular expressions, Sanitize has no trouble dealing with malformed
or maliciously-formed HTML. When in doubt, Sanitize always errs on the side of
caution.

== Requires

* RubyGems
* Hpricot 0.6+

== Usage

If you don't specify any configuration options, Sanitize will use its strictest
settings by default, which means it will strip all HTML.

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'sanitize'

  html = '<b><a href="http://foo.com/">foo</a></b><img src="http://foo.com/bar.jpg" />'

  Sanitize.clean(html) # => 'foo'

== Configuration

In addition to the ultra-safe default settings, Sanitize comes with three other
built-in modes.

=== Sanitize::Config::RESTRICTED

Allows only very simple inline formatting markup. No links, images, or block
elements.

  Sanitize.clean(html, Sanitize::Config::RESTRICTED) # => '<b>foo</b>'

=== Sanitize::Config::BASIC

Allows a variety of markup including formatting tags, links, and lists. Images
and tables are not allowed, links are limited to FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, and mailto
protocols, and a <code>rel="nofollow"</code> attribute is added to all links to
mitigate SEO spam.

  Sanitize.clean(html, Sanitize::Config::BASIC)
  # => '<b><a href="http://foo.com/" rel="nofollow">foo</a></b>'

=== Sanitize::Config::RELAXED

Allows an even wider variety of markup than BASIC, including images and tables.
Links are still limited to FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, and mailto protocols, while images
are limited to HTTP and HTTPS. In this mode, <code>rel="nofollow"</code> is not
added to links.

  Sanitize.clean(html, Sanitize::Config::RELAXED)
  # => '<b><a href="http://foo.com/">foo</a></b><img src="http://foo.com/bar.jpg" />'

=== Custom Configuration

If the built-in modes don't meet your needs, you can easily specify a custom
configuration:

  Sanitize.clean(html, :elements => ['a', 'span'],
      :attributes => {'a' => ['href', 'title'], 'span' => ['class']},
      :protocols => {'a' => {'href' => ['http', 'https', 'mailto']}})

==== :elements

Array of element names to allow. Specify all names in lowercase.

  :elements => [
    'a', 'b', 'blockquote', 'br', 'cite', 'code', 'dd', 'dl', 'dt', 'em',
    'i', 'li', 'ol', 'p', 'pre', 'q', 'small', 'strike', 'strong', 'sub',
    'sup', 'u', 'ul'
  ]

==== :attributes

Attributes to allow for specific elements. Specify all element names and
attributes in lowercase.

  :attributes => {
    'a'          => ['href', 'title'],
    'blockquote' => ['cite'],
    'img'        => ['alt', 'src', 'title']
  }

If you'd like to allow certain attributes on all elements, use the symbol
<code>:all</code> instead of an element name.

  :attributes => {
    :all => ['class'],
    'a'  => ['href', 'title']
  }

==== :add_attributes

Attributes to add to specific elements. If the attribute already exists, it will
be replaced with the value specified here. Specify all element names and
attributes in lowercase.

  :add_attributes => {
    'a' => {'rel' => 'nofollow'}
  }

==== :protocols

URL protocols to allow in specific attributes. If an attribute is listed here
and contains a protocol other than those specified (or if it contains no
protocol at all), it will be removed.

  :protocols => {
    'a'   => {'href' => ['ftp', 'http', 'https', 'mailto']},
    'img' => {'src'  => ['http', 'https']}
  }

If you'd like to allow the use of relative URLs which don't have a protocol,
include the symbol <code>:relative</code> in the protocol array:

  :protocols => {
    'a' => {'href' => ['http', 'https', :relative]}
  }

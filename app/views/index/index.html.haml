      Welcome to AmberNET!  Currently the site is in a beta testing period.  Feel free to browse around and poke at the site.  There will be a bug reporting form up in the coming weeks.     
    %p 
      Please note that the AmberNET database contains a list of shows and recordings.  
      There might be more than one recording for some shows while other shows may have no recordings.  Currently there is only one show available for download and streaming but more will be posted before the launch.  Recordings should be in rotation on a monthly basis based on user interest.  A voting system will be put in place to decide which shows are available.
    %p 
      All setlist data is pulled directly from  
      %a{:href => "http://perpetualarchives.mongoosecommunication.com"} Perpetual Archives. 
      We would like to thank Rick Hadley and Bridger Deville for tracking and making this data accessible.

    %a{:href => "#"} Streaming
  %div
    %p 
      All recordings on AmberNET can be streamed using pls or m3u playlist files.  If you wish to stream shows using a laptop make sure you have an application associated with whichever file type you choose.  
    %p 
      Streaming on an iPhone or iPod Touch requires that you have an application 
      do do so.
